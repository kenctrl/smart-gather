# Iterate through each csv
# For each csv, find column names
# Embed the column names

# Collect embeddings and find the csv with the most similar embeddings
# For each column in the most similar csv, find the most similar column in the input schema (if it exists)
# If the similarity is above a threshold, then add the data to the output schema
